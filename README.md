Roads are an essential part of the transportation system. 
Older roads tend to deteriorate faster due to environmental conditions such as high traffic,and climate fluctuation.
Assessment of these roads are often expensive and some cities have tight budget to assess the entire of the region.

The yearly budget used in this evaluation is between $200,000 and $230,000. The system has been extended for a period of 10 years and includes between 2 to 4 roadways per year that can be repaved[1]. 

Recently, roadways index in the US rated as D. Pavement condition is one of the critical indicators of regional prosperity and public well-being. If the department of transportation has a tool to evaluate the pavement they can expedite the process of pavement assessment and budget allocation to fix them.


I developed a web app that can be used as a toolbox for them to evaluate the pavement and provide a geolocation heat map index for them.

The challenges of this project was to find a solution with the use of google street view and come up with a fast and reliable machine vision solution to evaluate them.

Currently there are multiple research papers and old fasion assessemnt papers but none is provoding a user friendly web app to provide the quality of the roads on a street.

In this project the speed of processing is improved to 35 frame per second, The scale is expanded to the region and zip code, the design is improved to a friendly user web app, and is extensible for future improvement on every section.
